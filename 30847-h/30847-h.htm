<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> subject of compounds is one of the most difficult of the matters
relating to correct literary composition. The difficulty arises from the
fact that usage, especially in the matter of the presence or absence of
the hyphen, is not clearly settled. Progressive tendencies are at work
and there is great difference of usage, even among authorities of the
first rank, with regard to many compounds in common use.</p>

<p>An attempt is made to show first the general character of the problems
involved. Then follows a discussion of the general principles of
compounding. The general rules for the formation of compounds are stated
and briefly discussed. The various components of compounds are fully
analyzed and tabulated. The best modern usage in the matter of the
employment of the hyphen is set forth in a series of rules. The whole is
concluded by practical advice to the compositor as to the use of the
rules in the actual work of the office.</p>

<h2>COMPOUND WORDS</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> English language contains a great many words and phrases which are
made up of two or more words combined or related in such a way as to
form a new verbal phrase having a distinct meaning of its own and
differing in meaning from the sum of the component words taken singly.
<i>Income</i> and <i>outgo</i>, for example, have quite definite meanings related,
it is true, to <i>come</i> and <i>go</i> and to <i>in</i> and <i>out</i>, but sharply
differentiated from those words in their ordinary and general
signification. We use these compound words and phrases so commonly that
we never stop to think how numerous they are, or how frequently new ones
are coined. Any living language is constantly growing and developing new
forms. New objects have to be named, new sensations expressed, new experiences described.</p>

<p>Sometimes these words are mere aggregations like <i>automobile</i>,
<i>monotype</i>, <i>sidewalk</i>, <i>policeman</i> and the like. Sometimes, indeed very
often, they are short cuts. A <i>hatbox</i> is a box for carrying a hat, a
<i>red-haired</i> man is a man with red hair. A <i>bookcase</i> is a case to contain books, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes the phrase consists of two or more separate words, such as
<i>well known</i> or <i>nicely kept</i>. Sometimes it consists of words joined by
a hyphen, such as <i>boarding-house</i>, <i>sleeping-car</i>. Sometimes it
consists of a single word formed by amalgamating or running together the
components, such as <i>penholder</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>.</p>

<p>In which of these forms shall we write the phrase we speak so easily?
How shall we shape the new word we have just coined? Which of these
three forms shall we use, and why? Ordinarily we look for the answer to
such questions from three sources, historical development, the past of
the language; some logical principle of general application; or some
recognized standard of authority.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> Unfortunately we get little help from
either of these sources in this special difficulty.</p>

<p>The history of the language is a history of constant change. The
Anglo-Saxon tongue was full of compounds, but the hyphen was an unknown
device to those who spoke it. The English of Chaucer, the period when
our new-born English tongue was differentiated from those which
contributed to its composition, is full of compounds, and the compounds
were generally written with a hyphen. Shakespeare used many compound
words and phrases some of which sound strange, if not uncouth, to modern
ears, but used the hyphen much less than Chaucer. In modern times the
tendency has been and is to drop the hyphen. The more general
progression seems to be (1) two words, (2) two words hyphenated, (3) two
words run together into one. Sometimes, however, the hyphen drops,
leaving two words separated. That there is constant change, and that the
change is progressing consistently in the direction of eliminating the
hyphen is fairly clear. This, however, does not help us much. At what
stage of the process are we with regard to any given word? Which form of
the process is operating in any given case?</p>

<p>There are no laws or principles of universal application on which we may
build a consistent system of practice. Certain general principles have
been laid down and will be here set forth. While they are helpful to the
understanding of the subject they are not sufficiently universal to
serve as practical guides in all cases. In any event they need to be
supplemented by careful study of the rules for the use of the hyphen, by
careful study of the best usage in particular cases, and by thorough
knowledge of the style of each particular office, as will be pointed out
later. Authorities and usage differ widely, and it is often difficult to
say that a particular form is right or wrong.</p>

<p>There is no recognized standard authority. The dictionaries do not agree
with each other and are not always consistent with themselves. They may
always write a certain word in a certain way but they may write another
word to all appearance exactly analogous to the first in another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> way.
For example Worcester has <i>brickwork</i> and <i>brasswork</i>, but <i>wood-work</i>
and <i>iron-work</i>. Webster, on the other hand, has <i>woodwork</i> and <i>brick-work</i>.</p>

<p>The best that the printer can do is to adopt a set of rules or style of
his own and stick to it consistently. Here and there a generally
accepted change, like the dropping of the hyphen from <i>tomorrow</i> and
<i>today</i> will force itself upon him, but for the most part he may stick
to his style. Of course, the author, if he has a marked preference, must
be permitted to use his own methods of compounding except in magazine
publications and the like. In such cases, when the author&#8217;s work is to
appear in the same volume with that of other writers, the style of the
printing office must rule and the individual contributors must bow to
it.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<h3>GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h3>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Three</span> general principles are laid down by Mr. F. Horace Teall which will
be found useful, though they must be supplemented in practice by more
specific rules which will be given later. They are as follows:</p>

<p>I<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>All words should be separate when used in regular grammatical
relations and construction unless they are jointly applied in some arbitrary way.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An <i>iron fence</i> means a fence made of iron. The meaning and
construction are normal and the words are not compounded.</p>

<p>An <i>iron-saw</i> means a saw for cutting iron. The meaning is not the
same as <i>iron saw</i> which would mean a saw made of iron. The
hyphenated compound indicates the special meaning of the words used in this combination.</p>

<p><i>Ironwood</i> is a specific name applied to a certain kind of very
hard wood. Hence, it becomes a single word compounded but without a
hyphen. Either of the other forms would be ambiguous or impossible in meaning.</p></div>

<p>II<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Abnormal associations of words generally indicate unification in
sense and hence compounding in form.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A <i>sleeping man</i> is a phrase in which the words are associated
normally. The man sleeps.</p>

<p>A <i>sleeping-car</i> is a phrase in which the words are associated
abnormally. The car does not sleep. It is a specially constructed
car in which the passengers may sleep comfortably.</p>

<p>A <i>king fisher</i> might be a very skilful fisherman. A <i>kingfisher</i>
is a kind of bird. Here again we have an abnormal association of
words and as the compound word is the name of a specific sort of
bird there is no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> hyphen. A <i>king-fisher</i>, if it meant anything,
would probably mean one who fished for kings, as a <i>pearl-diver</i> is one who dives for pearls.</p></div>

<p>III<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Conversely, no expression in the language should ever be changed
from two or more words into one (either hyphenated or solid) without change of sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Saw trimmer</i> is not compounded because there is no change in the
commonly accepted sense of either word.</p>

<p><i>Color work</i> is not compounded because the word <i>color</i>, by usage
common in English, has the force of an adjective, and the words are
used in their accepted sense. In other languages it would be
differently expressed, for example, in French it would be <i>oeuvre</i>,
or <i>imprimerie en couleur</i>, <i>work</i>, or, <i>printing in color</i>.</p>

<p><i>Presswork</i> is compounded because it has a special and specific
meaning. Good or bad presswork is a good or bad result of work done on a press.</p>

<p>Here as everywhere in printing the great purpose is to secure
plainness and intelligibility. Print is made to read. Anything
which obscures the sense, or makes the passage hard to read is
wrong. Anything which clears up the sense and makes the passage
easy to read and capable of only one interpretation is right.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INFLUENCE OF ACCENT IN COMPOUNDING</h3>

<p>Some writers lay much stress on the influence of accent in the formation
of compounds while others ignore it entirely. Accent undoubtedly has
some influence and the theory may be easily and intelligibly expressed.
It ought to be understood, but it will not be found an entirely safe
guide. Usage has modified the results of compounding in many cases in
ways which do not lend themselves to logical explanation and classification.</p>

<p>The general principle as stated by Mr. Teall is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When each part of the compound is accented, use the hyphen; <i>laughter-loving</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>When only one part is accented, omit the hyphen; <i>many sided</i>.</p>

<p>When the accent is changed, print the compound solid; <i>broadsword</i>.
This follows the general rule of accenting the first syllable in English words.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RULES FOR THE FORMATION OF COMPOUNDS</h3>

<p>I<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Two nouns used together as a name form a compound noun unless:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>a</i>) The first is used in a descriptive or attributive sense, that is, is really an adjective, or</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The two are in apposition.</p></div>

<p>Various uses of the noun as an adjective, that is, in some qualifying or
attributive sense are when the noun conveys the sense of:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. &#8220;Made of;&#8221; <i>leather belt</i>, <i>steel furniture</i>.</p>

<p>2. &#8220;Having the shape, character, or quality of;&#8221; <i>diamond pane</i>,
<i>iron ration</i>, <i>bull calf</i>.</p>

<p>3. &#8220;Pertaining to, suitable for, representing;&#8221; <i>office desk</i>, <i>labor union</i>.</p>

<p>4. &#8220;Characterized by;&#8221; <i>motor drive</i>.</p>

<p>5. &#8220;Situated in, and the like;&#8221; <i>ocean current</i>, <i>city life</i>.</p>

<p>6. &#8220;Supporting or advocating;&#8221; <i>union man</i>, <i>Bryan voter</i>.</p>

<p>7. &#8220;Existing in or coming from;&#8221; <i>Yellowstone geyser</i>, <i>California lemon</i>.</p>

<p>8. &#8220;Originated or made by, named for;&#8221; <i>Gordon Press</i>, <i>Harvard College</i>.</p>

<p>Placing the two nouns in apposition is much the same as using the first as an adjective.</p>

<p>Such compounds are generally written as two words without the
hyphen, but see specific rules for use of hyphens.</p></div>

<p>II<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Every name apparently composed of a plain noun and a noun of agent or
verbal noun, but really conveying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> the sense of a phrase with suffix
<i>er</i>, <i>or</i>, or <i>ing</i>, should be treated as a compound; <i>roller distribution</i>.</p>

<p>III<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Possessive phrases used as specific names (generally plants) are treated as compounds.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They are hyphenated unless very common, in which case they are
closed up; <i>crane&#8217;s-bill</i>, <i>ratsbane</i>.</p></div>

<p>IV<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any phrase used as a specific name in an arbitrary application not
strictly figurative is written as a compound; <i>blueberry</i>, <i>red-coat</i>, <i>forget-me-not</i>.</p>

<p>V<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any pair of words used as one name of which the second is a noun but
the first not really an adjective should be written as a compound;
<i>foster-brother</i>, <i>down-town</i>, <i>after-consideration</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As elsewhere the use of the hyphen depends largely in the
familiarity of the phrase; <i>spoilsport</i>, <i>pickpocket</i>.</p></div>

<p>VI<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any two words other than nouns should be treated as a compound,
generally solid, when arbitrarily associated as a name; <i>standpoint</i>, <i>outlook</i>.</p>

<p>VII<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>A name or an adjective made by adding a suffix to a proper name
compounded of two words should be treated as a compound with a hyphen;
<i>East-Indian</i>, <i>New-Yorker</i>. If the name is not inflected this rule does
not apply; <i>East India Company</i>, <i>New York man</i>.</p>

<p>VIII<span class="spacer2">&nbsp;</span>Any pair or series of words arbitrarily associated in a joint sense
different from their sense when used separately, should be compounded; <i>workman-like</i>, <i>warlike</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>COMPONENTS OF COMPOUNDS</h3>

<p>Compounds having the force of nouns may be made up in several ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Two nouns used in other than their natural signification; <i>claw-hammer</i>.</p>

<p>2. A noun and an adjective used in other than their natural signification; <i>great-uncle</i>, <i>dry-goods</i>.</p>

<p>3. A noun and an adverb; <i>touch-down</i>, <i>holder-forth</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>4. A noun and an adverb; <i>down-draft</i>, <i>flare-back</i>.</p>

<p>10. A verb and a preposition; <i>to-do</i>, <i>go-between</i>.</p></div>

<p>Compounds having the force of adjectives may be made up in several ways.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A group of words compacted into one idea; <i>never-to-be-forgotten</i>.</p>

<p>2. Two adjectives; <i>white-hot</i>, <i>ashy-blue</i>.</p>

<p>3. An adjective and a participle or noun and suffix simulating a
participle; <i>odd-looking</i>, <i>foreign-born</i>, <i>bow-legged</i>.</p>

<p>4. An adjective and a noun; <i>fire-new</i>, <i>type-high</i>.</p>

<p>5. A noun and a participle (or noun and suffix simulating a
participle); <i>hand-printed</i>, <i>peace-making</i>.</p>

<p>6. An adverb and an adjective used together before a noun; <i>well-bred</i>, <i>long-extended</i>.</p>

<p>7. Two nouns used adjectively before another noun; <i>cotton-seed
oil</i>, <i>shoe-sewing machine</i>, <i>Sunday-school teacher</i>.</p>

<p>8. An adjective and a noun used together before a noun;
<i>civil-service examination</i>, <i>free-trade literature</i>, <i>fresh-water sailor</i>.</p>

<p>9. A verb and a noun; <i>John Lack-land</i>.</p></div>

<p>Four compounds occur with the force of verbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Two verbs; <i>balance-reef</i>.</p>

<p>2. A verb and a noun; <i>silver-plate</i>, <i>house-break</i>.</p>

<p>Several combinations are used with the force of adverbs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Two adverbs; <i>upright</i>, <i>henceforth</i>.</p>

<p>2. A noun and an adverb; <i>brain-sickly</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>3. An adjective and an adverb (or compound adjective with suffix,
simulating an adverb); <i>stout-heartedly</i>, <i>ill-naturedly</i>.</p>

<p>4. An adjective and a verb; <i>broadcast</i>.</p>

<p>7. A noun and a preposition; <i>down-stairs</i>, <i>above-board</i>, <i>offhand</i>.</p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>RULES FOR THE USE OF THE HYPHEN</h3>

<p>1. Hyphenate nouns formed by the combination of two nouns standing in
objective relation to each other, that is, one of whose components is
derived from a transitive verb:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">
<tr><td><i>well-wisher</i></td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>wood-turning</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>mind-reader</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>child-study</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>office-holder</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>clay-modeling</i></td></tr></table>

<p>When such compounds are in very common use, and especially when they
have a specific or technical meaning, they are printed solid;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">
<tr><td><i>typewriter</i></td><td><span class="spacer">&nbsp;</span></td><td><i>stockholder</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>proofreader</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>copyholder</i></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>lawgiver</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>dressmaker</i></td></tr></table>

<p>2. Hyphenate a combination of a present participle with a noun when the
meaning of the combination is different from that of the two words taken
separately; <i>boarding-house</i>, <i>sleeping-car</i>, <i>walking-stick</i>.</p>

<p>3. Hyphenate a combination of a present participle with a preposition
used absolutely (not governing the following noun); <i>the putting-in or
taking-out of a hyphen</i>.</p>

<p>4. As a rule compounds of <i>book</i>, <i>house</i>, <i>will</i>, <i>room</i>, <i>shop</i>, and
<i>work</i> should be printed solid when the prefixed noun has one syllable;
should be hyphenated when it contains two; should be printed in two
separate words when it contains three or more;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>handbook</i>, <i>notebook</i>, <i>story-book</i>, <i>pocket-book</i>, <i>reference book</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><i>clubhouse</i>, <i>storehouse</i>, <i>engine-house</i>, <i>power-house</i>,
<i>business-house</i>.</p>

<p><i>handmill</i>, <i>sawmill</i>, <i>water-mill</i>, <i>paper-mill</i>, <i>chocolate mill</i>.</p>

<p><i>classroom</i>, <i>lecture-room</i>, <i>recitation room</i>.</p>

<p><i>tinshop</i>, <i>tailor-shop</i>, <i>carpenter shop</i>.</p>

<p><i>woodwork</i>, <i>metal-work</i>, <i>filigree work</i>.</p></div>

<p>Unusual combinations such as <i>source-book</i> and <i>wheat-mill</i> are
sometimes hyphenated, and the hyphen is sometimes omitted for the sake
of the appearance as in <i>school work</i>.</p>

<p>5. Compounds of <i>maker</i>, <i>dealer</i>, and other words denoting occupation
are generally hyphenated; <i>harness-maker</i>, <i>job-printer</i>.</p>

<p>The tendency is to print these words solid when they come into very common use; <i>dressmaker</i>.</p>

<p>6. Hyphenate nouns when combined in an adjectival sense before the name
of the same person; <i>the martyr-president Lincoln</i>, <i>the poet-artist Rosetti.</i></p>

<p>7. Compounds of <i>store</i> are generally hyphenated when the prefix
contains one syllable, otherwise not; <i>drug-store</i>, <i>fruit-store</i> (but
<i>bookstore</i>), <i>provision store</i>.</p>

<p>8. Compounds of <i>fellow</i> are hyphenated; <i>fellow-being</i>, <i>play-fellow</i>, but <i>bedfellow</i>.</p>

<p>9. Compounds of <i>father</i>, <i>mother</i>, <i>brother</i>, <i>sister</i>, <i>daughter</i>,
<i>parent</i>, and <i>foster</i> should be hyphenated when the word in question

<p>22. Adjectives formed by a noun preceding <i>like</i> do not take a hyphen if
the noun is a monosyllable, except when ending in <i>l</i> or a proper noun;
if the noun contains more than one syllable a hyphen should be used;

by Mr. Jones, one quarter by Mr. Smith, and one eighth each by Mr.
Browne and Mr. Robinson.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>26. Where two or more compound words occur together having one of their
components in common, this component is often omitted from all but the
last word and the omission indicated by a hyphen;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>French-and Spanish-speaking countries</i>, <i>wood-iron-and
steel-work</i>, <i>one-two-three-four and five-cent stamps</i>.</p>

<p>This usage is objected to in some offices as being a Germanized
form. It is however, less ambiguous than where the hyphen is
omitted and is therefore preferable.</p></div>

<p>27. Ordinal numbers compounded with nouns take the hyphen in such
expressions as <i>second-hand</i>, <i>first-rate</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>28. Numerals of one syllable take a hyphen in compounds with
self-explanatory words such as <i>four-footed</i>, <i>one-eyed</i>, and the like.</p>

<p>29. Numerals compounded with nouns to form an adjective take the hyphen;
<i>twelve-inch rule</i>, <i>three-horse team</i>, <i>six-point lead</i>.</p>

<p>30. The hyphen is used in compounding a noun in the possessive case with
another noun; <i>jew&#8217;s-harp</i>, <i>crow&#8217;s-nest</i>.</p>

<p>31. The hyphen is used with most compounds of <i>tree</i>; <i>apple-tree</i>,
<i>quince-tree</i>, but not when a particular object, not a tree (vegetable),
is meant; <i>whippletree</i>, <i>crosstree</i>.</p>

<p>32. Use the hyphen in compounding two adjectives generally, especially
personal epithets; <i>asked-for opinion</i>, <i>sea-island cotton</i>, <i>dry-plate
process</i>, <i>hard-headed</i>, <i>strong-armed</i>, <i>broad-shouldered</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>33. The hyphen is not used in points of the compass unless doubly
compounded; <i>northeast</i>, <i>southwest</i>, <i>north-northeast</i>, <i>south-southwest by south</i>.</p>

<p>34. Compounds ending with <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i> are run solid; <i>pressman</i>, <i>forewoman</i>.</p>

<p>35. Omit the hyphen in such phrases as <i>by and by</i>, <i>by the bye</i>, <i>good
morning</i> (except when used adjectively, <i>a good-morning greeting</i>,)
<i>attorney at law</i>, <i>coat of arms</i>.</p>

<p>36. Compounds ending in <i>holder</i> and <i>monger</i> are run solid;
<i>bondholder</i>, <i>cheesemonger</i>.</p>

<p>38. Compounds unless very unusual, beginning with <i>deutero</i>, <i>electro</i>,

<p>39. Do not separate</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">

<tr><td><i>everywhere</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>anyway</i></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>somewhat</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td><i>somewhere</i></td></tr></table>

<p>In phrases like <i>in the meantime</i> and <i>forever and ever</i> the words are printed separately.</p>

<p><i>Any one</i> and <i>some one</i> are separate words.</p>

<p>40. In compounds of color the hyphen is not used except when a noun is
used with an adjective to specify color; <i>reddish-brown</i>, <i>gray-white</i>,
<i>lemon-yellow</i>, <i>olive-green</i>, <i>silver-gray</i>.</p>

<p>41. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which should be
hyphenated, and which do not fall under any of the above classifications.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="words">

<p>These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of
good authorities from DeVinne (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913). The
great practical difficulty is that authorities differ as to their
application. DeVinne uses the dieresis instead of the hyphen in such
cases as <i>co-operate</i> or <i>pre-eminent</i>, writing <i>co&ouml;perate</i>,
<i>pre&euml;minent</i>. Many of the rules have exceptions and authorities differ
as to the extent of the exceptions. There are many differences in the
great number of unclassified compounds. For example, Manly and Powell
write <i>coat-of-arms</i>, while Orcutt writes <i>coat of arms</i>. Common usage
omits the hyphen from post office except when used as an adjective, e. g.,
<i>post-office accounts</i>.</p>

<p>A strict adherence to the rules given would probably result, not in bad
composition, but in a much greater use of hyphens than would be found on
the pages of many recent books from the presses of some of the best
publishers. This is due partly to the fact that usage has never been
strictly uniform and partly to the constant progressive change noted at
the beginning of this study. We are gradually discontinuing the use of
the hyphen just as we are diminishing our use of capital letters,
punctuation marks, and italics.</p>

<p>The compositor should ground himself thoroughly in the principles and
rules. He should learn the best usage with regard to special words and
phrases. He should master the office style. He should follow copy if the
author has distinct and definite ideas which are not absolutely wrong
and would not introduce inconsistencies in magazines and the like by
violating the office style which is followed in other parts of the same
publication. If it is clear that the author knows what he wants, the
compositor should follow copy. Questions of correctness and conformity
to style belong not to him but to the copy editor and proofreader.</p>

<p>In this volume, as in so many in this section, much depends upon
practice drills. The memorizing of rules is difficult and is of very
little use unless accompanied by a great deal of practice so that the
apprentice will become so thoroughly familiar with them that he will
apply them at once without conscious thought. He should no more think of
the rule when he writes <i>fellow-man</i>, than he thinks of the
multiplication table when he says seven times eight are fifty-six. This
drill may be given in several ways, by asking the student to explain the
use or omission of hyphens in printed matter, by giving written matter
purposely incorrect in parts and asking him to set it correctly, or by
giving dictations and having the apprentice write out the matter and
then set it up. Later, when it will not be too wasteful of time, the
apprentice can be given the ordinary run of copy as customers send it in
and told to set it in correct form. He will probably find enough errors
in it to test his knowledge of compounding and of many other things.</p>

<h2>TYPOGRAPHIC TECHNICAL SERIES<br />FOR APPRENTICES</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">The</span> following list of publications, comprising the <span class="smcap">Typographic Technical
Series for Apprentices</span>, has been prepared under the supervision of the
Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America for use in
trade classes, in course of printing instruction, and by individuals.</p>

<p>Each publication has been compiled by a competent author or group of
authors, and carefully edited, the purpose being to provide the printers
of the United States&mdash;employers, journeymen, and apprentices&mdash;with a
comprehensive series of handy and inexpensive compendiums of reliable,
up-to-date information upon the various branches and specialties of the
printing craft, all arranged in orderly fashion for progressive study.</p>

<p>The publications of the series are of uniform size, 5 x 8 inches. Their
general make-up, in typography, illustrations, etc., has been, as far as
practicable, kept in harmony throughout. A brief synopsis of the
particular contents and other chief features of each volume will be
found under each title in the following list.</p>

<p>Each topic is treated in a concise manner, the aim being to embody in
each publication as completely as possible all the rudimentary
information and essential facts necessary to an understanding of the
subject. Care has been taken to make all statements accurate and clear,
with the purpose of bringing essential information within the
understanding of beginners in the different fields of study. Wherever
practicable, simple and well-defined drawings and illustrations have
been used to assist in giving additional clearness to the text.</p>

<p>In order that the pamphlets may be of the greatest possible help for use
in trade-school classes and for self-instruction, each title is
accompanied by a list of Review Questions covering essential items of
the subject matter. A short Glossary of technical terms belonging to the
subject or department treated is also added to many of the books.</p>

<p>These are the Official Text-books of the United Typothetae of America.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">This</span> series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
